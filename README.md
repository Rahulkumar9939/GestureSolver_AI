# GestureSolver_AI

## Overview
The Vision Solver is an innovative feature of the GestureSolver AI project that leverages advanced generative AI technologies to interpret and solve mathematical equations drawn by users on a digital canvas. This component enhances educational experiences by allowing users to engage interactively with mathematical concepts through hand gestures.

## Key Features
- **Handwritten Equation Recognition**: Users can draw mathematical symbols or equations using hand gestures, which are captured and processed by the system.
- **Real-time Problem Solving**: The Vision Solver employs Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5) to decode and solve the drawn equations in real-time, providing immediate feedback to users.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features an intuitive interface that facilitates easy interaction, making learning more engaging and accessible.

## Technologies Used
- **Generative AI**: Google Gemini 1.5 for interpreting and solving equations.
- **Computer Vision**: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for accurate gesture detection and tracking.
- **Image Processing**: Converts drawn gestures into digital images for analysis.

## How It Works
1. **Input Capture**: The user draws equations on the screen using hand gestures.
2. **Image Processing**: The system processes the captured gestures, converting them into digital images.
3. **AI Integration**: The processed image is sent to the generative AI model, which interprets the handwritten input and translates it into a structured format.
4. **Problem Solving**: The AI computes the solution using its mathematical engine, displaying the result directly on the interface.

## Conclusion
The GestureSolver_AI represents a significant advancement in interactive learning technology, combining gesture recognition with AI to enhance problem-solving capabilities. It paves the way for more effective and engaging educational tools, making mathematics accessible and enjoyable for users of all ages.
